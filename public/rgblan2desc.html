       <p>RGB LAN is a 3-day long, Bring-Your-Own-Computer (BYOC) LAN party. We hold dozens of PC and console tournaments and give away thousands of dollars in prizes. To add to the fun, attendees at RGB LAN are broken into three teams, Red, Green, and Blue (get it?). Each team is paired with a truly awesome local charity. Every time a team wins, its charity gets a donation and its players get a prize. 
  
Red Team will be supporting Paws For Courage 
Green Team will be supporting Help Hope Live 
Blue Team will be supporting Eden Autism </p>RGB LAN is a 3-day long, Bring-Your-Own-Computer (BYOC) LAN party.
